1,rapecounseling,"**RapeCounseling is dedicated to providing emotional support to those who have experienced rape or any type of sexualized violence.**

Sub Rules:
**Please note:** Violation of any rules, intentional or not, will likely result in a ban.  If you believe you were mistakenly banned, please contact the Moderation Team to discuss.

1) **RapeCounseling is a public subreddit and available to anyone wishing to view the posts.**
While we do our best to review and moderate posts, we can't catch everything.  We rely on the community to use the report button to alert us to potential problems.

2) **No Victim-Blaming/Shaming of poster's experiences.**  
This is a safe, supportive community.  There are many difficult discussions and expressions of sexualized trauma and, while we wish to be open to all survivors' experiences, shaming anyone for what they did to make it through their assault and their attempts to cope after are not avenues for your take on right and wrong ways to heal.  There is NO wrong way to deal & heal!

3) **No Private Messaging or Chat to any poster or commenter unless explicitly invited.**
This is generally a non-reversible bannable offense.  We have attempted to allow private discussion between users, but this has more often led to abuse by predators looking to further exploit our community.

4) **Researchers/Academics who wish to post their study, contact the Moderators prior to posting.**
We will remove all non-approved posts.

11,Antipsychiatry,"Welcome to r/antipsychiatry! 

We acknowledge that even short-term use of psychiatric drugs can cause permanent damage, and we oppose the involuntary use of psychiatric drugs in all circumstances. 

We oppose the power imbalances inherent in the mental health system. 

We support self-ownership of your body; an informed person can use drugs if they feel they need to.

We believe that:
>
1. The specific definitions of, or criteria for, hundreds of current psychiatric diagnoses or disorders are vague & arbitrary, leaving too much room for opinions and interpretations to meet basic scientific standards.  
>
2. Prevailing psychiatric treatments are ultimately far more damaging than helpful to patients.

**Rules:**

1. No spam. Repetitive posts may be deleted.

2. No personal attacks or submissions where the purpose is to name & insult another redditor.

3. No brigading other subreddits. Don't send visitors where they are not wanted.

4. No advocating assault or torture.

5. Do not ask for medical advice. Do not give medical advice.

Otherwise, we want to *maximize free speech* and encourage debating. 

**Provider Directories:**

* Licensed psych workers who MAY be able to help with psych drug withdrawal, or may have reformist views. Beware of any promoting their own quack therapy.

**Green Flair:** *Physicians.* This includes only physicians. The types of physicians include, but not limited to: Internal Medicine, Pediatrician, Emergency Medicine, Dermatologist, Obstetrician/Gynecologist, Family Medicine, Gastroenterologist, ENT, Neurologist, etc.  These users are professionals in their field and are usually the most credible users.

This includes but not limited to: All science/medical PhDs, Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, Nursing PhD, Physical Therapy PhD, PsyD, Pharmacists etc.

This includes: Nurses (All-Types), Medical Assistants, Lab Technicians, Counselors/Therapists etc.

**Yellow Flair:** *Students.* These users are medical students. This category may also include non-professional certificate holders, such as EMT-B's. These users are still in school and might not have level of knowledge or expertise as those users in the Green, Blue, or Orange categories.

If the user has a grey **This user has not yet been verified.** flair or no flair at all, they have not been verified as being a medical professional by the mod team OR they are not a medical professional at all. Take advice from these users with caution.

17,bulimia,"**/r/bulimia is for anyone experiencing Bulimia, Anorexia, binge eating, restricting, over control and other disordered eating patterns. You are welcome here.**

**A few guidelines:**



**1. Some of r/bulimia may be upsetting or triggering. Harm-reduction tips, humor, personal stories, discussion of *adverse effects* of bulimia and references to numbers are welcome but glorifying or facilitating EDs is not.**

**2. Because of these triggers, we don't encourage or allow selfies or food pictures. Memes, art, surveys and videos are invited and approved individually.**

**3. Please be kind. Not everyone deals with this the same way. Please report invalidation, stigma and shame**

---
In **Bulimia Nervosa**, binge eating is coupled with compensatory behaviors (e.g., self-induced vomiting, laxatives, excessive exercise and/or fasting). This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame and embarrassment, as well as preoccupation with eating, body image and fear of weight gain

---

**Why do we talk about it?**

Dietary restrictions intended to promote health may paradoxically lead to unhealthy consequences, such as social isolation, anxiety, loss of ability to eat in a natural, intuitive manner, reduced interest in the full range of other healthy human activities.

---
What else?

- **Anorexia** can affect people of all ages, genders, sizes, sexual orientations, races, and ethnicities.

- **ARFID**: lack of interest in food or lack of appetite, aversion to certain textures, or feared consequences of eating

- **binge eating**:  characterized by eating an unusually large amount of food coupled with a sense of feeling out of control

- **restricting**:  severely restrict the amount and type of food.  May also engage in other weight control behaviours such as excessive exercise.

18,CompulsiveSkinPicking,"**Our Community**

* A place for people with Compulsive Skin Picking (CSP), their families, friends, and therapists who treat this condition to come together and exchange news about treatments, current events, and personal experiences.

All posts are allowed here, including potentially triggering content. For a trigger friendly, text post only version of this community, please visit /r/Dermatillomania.

**About CSP**



* People with CSP feel compelled to pick at real or perceived blemishes (acne, dry skin, callouses, or other textural anomalies); resisting these urges is akin to resisting the urge to cough or to scratch an itch.

* CSP is an Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorder, and  sometimes also referred to as dermatillomania.  In the DSM-5, it is called ""Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder"".

* Engaging in these compulsions can lead to pain, infections, scarring, and social stigma, as well as feelings of shame, guilt, and depression.

* Treatments exist for CSP, and they involve hard work in therapy aimed at reducing the frequency and duration of picking episodes. Medications may help, but there are no cures. 



**Want to learn more?**

* Our **[ wiki page](/r/compulsiveskinpicking/wiki/index)** contains in-depth information on CSP, tips for coping with CSP, and information for friends and family of people struggling with CSP.

19,dbtselfhelp," Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a system of therapy originally developed by Marsha M. Linehan. DBT combines standard cognitive-behavioral techniques for emotion regulation and reality-testing with concepts of distress tolerance, acceptance, and mindful awareness largely derived from Buddhist meditative practice. This community is for people who have taken, are taking, or *want to learn* and practice DBT skills.  

This Reddit is not staffed by mental health professionals or therapists. We are a community of people who have been through DBT therapy (or are going through DBT Therapy) and can offer some peer support.

Our subreddit focuses on helping others learn DBT, refining DBT skills, helping to answer questions posed about DBT skills, and offering assistance in practicing/using skills.  Please keep it DBT!

At any time moderators may remove posts deemed inappropriate, and our decisions are final.

24,EOOD,"#Welcome to /r/EOOD

EOOD is short for Exercise Out Of Depression.

##What EOOD is

EOOD is a welcoming and positive place to discuss exercise and mental health and the relationship between them. We welcome everyone here regardless of age, race, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation and social or economic status. We also do not limit ourselves to talking about Depression and cover all aspects of mental health, however we can't change the name of the sub now.

People in this sub try to help one another but none of us are medical or exercise professionals, we are just random well meaning internet strangers. All we can say is ""I was in a similar situation to you and this helped me."" EOOD is not a replacement for medical professionals. 

If you are experiencing any mental health problem **PLEASE SPEAK TO A DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE**. 

If you are unable to speak to a doctor then try to contact a crisis line, mental health charity or a responsible person you trust. 

**IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS PLEASE CALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES NOW**.

While the focus of this sub is obviously exercise and mental health and we appreciate it if posts and comments are related to this we try to help as many people as possible here. If you feel this is a place where you can talk then we will try to listen and do what we can to help within our own experience.


##What EOOD isn't.

EOOD is not a commercial space. We are not here to promote your youtube channel, website, supplements, diet program, wellness business or any other commercial activity. The exception to this is that we do allow medical and academic studies seeking participants to post here but we ask that they contact the moderators first so we can vet the study for our users safety.

EOOD is not a place where people come together to complain and be negative. We try to be as positive as we can whilst acknowledging that we are all people that are facing severe problems. We try to help and support everyone if we feel we are able to.

*Anything intended to cause others to feel unhappy or uncomfortable in any way will not be tolerated*. We are here to support other people. If you are uncomfortable about any posts or comments in this sub please report them and message the moderators. We will take action as soon as we are able to. 


##More Resources

Unlike many exercise focussed subs we do not have a wiki with recommended exercise routines. This is because we do not want posters to the sub to be greeted with a ""Read the wiki"" message instead of receiving help and support. We do have a list of other resources for both exercise and mental health which we hope you find useful [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EOOD/wiki/index)."

####Rules:

 - 1: Be polite, friendly and welcoming.

 - 2: Do not tell anyone they are not forever alone enough to be here. Foreveralone has no firm definition but [here is a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_59IpaAENmI9y0cltCe9oFmjWEelHraq69GEfu-gyTY/edit?pli=1#gid=0) that gives an idea of what it's all about.  Forever Alone is not something you achieve, its something you use to describe yourself.

 - 3: Do not post inflammatory comments or threads designed to generalize, demean, insult or otherwise degrade an entire group of people (race, gender, sexual orientation, religion etc).

 - 4: This is not an incel sub, any incel references, slang, or inference will be deemed hate speech and met with a ban. No ""suifuel"" threads.

 - 5: Avoid posts that serve only to advertise other blogs, subreddits or external sites as we have no control over these external resources. Any such posts may be removed. 

 - 6: If you see trolling, [report it to the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23ForeverAlone&subject=Trolling).

 - 7: Any posts created to intentionally start drama on any subject will be removed.  (i.e. linking other subreddits, crossposts to other subreddits, publicly calling out other users, etc.) This also includes Meta conversations about the sub or Moderation Policy.

 - 8: Do not post your dick.

 - 9: If you have been muted by the mods during a PM conversation, and then directly PM a mod's personal account, you will be banned immediately.

26,getting_over_it,"**Supporting each other in conquering depression, anxiety, trauma, doubt, and apathy. This is a positive community dedicated to overcoming our challenges.**

We kindly request that posts in this subreddit include an element of introspection, such as steps to counteract negative thinking. Although we understand that setbacks do happen and should be acknowledged, this is the place to discuss how you are actively working to improve your mental health.

1. **Self-posts only.** Feel free to link to articles or media in a text submission that explains your reasoning for sharing the content. We request that all external links (e.g. videos, articles or blogs) should be focused on improving or reflecting on our mental health. Any links that are not directly related may be removed at the moderators' discretion.

2. **Posts that are disrespectful, abusive, dismissive, trolling or discriminatory will be removed and the user may be banned.** If you see any such posts, please report them. Also note that the moderators may tag or remove posts containing triggering content at their discretion.

3. **Posts about surveys, products and/or services**(including chatrooms!) **require mod approval**. Send a [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/getting_over_it) to ask us, but keep in mind that it is a request. Should we find that we have too many posts recently, we may not not allow the post to limit redundancy. For surveys, we require IRB approval.

4. **Do not advertise quick-fix or automatic cures.** While we are an action-based mental health community, one strategy doesn't work for everyone. It's okay to describe what *worked for you*, but not to advocate something in the tone off 'it'll absolutely cure your depression!'.

If your post or comment is not showing up, it may be stuck in the spam filter or it may have been removed for violating one of our rules. [Please message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/getting_over_it) if you have any questions.

Welcome to /r/OCD, a subreddit dedicated to discussion, articles, and images regarding Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

**Please keep in mind anything and everything in this subreddit may be considered triggering to those suffering with OCD or related disorders, use your own discretion while browsing.**

*Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)* is a disorder characterized by two components: obsessions and compulsions. 

Obsessions are intrusive thoughts that cause unease, apprehension, dysphoria, fear, or worry.

Compulsions are repetitive behaviours and actions, both internal and external, that one does with the aim of reducing the anxiety caused by obsessions.

**Have an OCD related meme you want to post?  Consider posting in /r/OCDmemes instead!**  Many of our users would appreciate it :)
_______________________________________________________

#RULES:

Rules for r/OCD.
Rules that visitors must follow to participate. May be used as reasons to report or ban.

#1.Do not ask /r/OCD for medical advice.#
Including: asking for a diagnosis, self-diagnosis confirmation, or opinions as to whether you have OCD.


#2.Do not give medical advice.#

This includes attempting to diagnose users.



#3.Keep submissions relevant to OCD.#
OCD is not synonymous with the mild feeling of annoyance caused by things like this, this, and this. Keep these posts to /r/mildlyinfuriating.


#4. Flair is required on all posts.#
Be sure to flair your post when you submit to keep everything organized and so people can filter out content they don't want to see.


#5. No Hate Speech#
Homophobia, transphobia, racism, or other behaviours that violate human dignity are strictly against rules. Bans will be issued for frequent offenders, or if the first offense is heinous.


#6.No Bullying#
Bullying includes harassment, following users to other subs, or targeted anger toward another subreddit user. While debate is encouraged, bullying is not.


#7. No Mental Illness/OCD Shaming#
All posts that shame people for OCD, such as,""that's not a real compulsion because I don't have it"", or any other forms of mental illness shaming is against the rules.


#8. No Unethical, Unverified or Otherwise Nonsense ""Treatments""#
All snakeoil treatments are banned from this subreddit. Those who post them are subject to removals and bans.


#9. No Low Quality Posts/Spam#
Please only make posts that have some purpose. Posts that are very short, contain little information or topics, are subject to removal. This includes links.
_____________________________________________________

#What do ROCD, TOCD, and so on mean? What is Pure-O?

Some of the more commonly used terms are:

**ROCD**: Relationship OCD  
**HOCD**: Homosexual/heterosexual OCD, also sometimes used for harm OCD  
**TOCD**: Trans OCD  
**POCD**:  Pedophilia OCD  
**COCD**: Contamination OCD  
**Pure-O**:  Purely obsessions

These terms are just easier ways for people to describe the ways their OCD manifests. For example, if your OCD mainly revolves around your relationship, you can say you have ROCD. If you have trans or homo/heterosexual related OCD you might say you have TOCD or HOCD. 

Keep in mind that these are not actual medical terms or diagnoses, OCD is the same no matter what you obsess about, and the treatment is the same regardless.  These terms are nothing more but shorthand for people to describe their symptoms more easily.

**Having obsessions about something does not mean you are that thing.**  Having POCD, e.g. OCD about being a pedophile, does not mean someone actually has pedophilic thoughts, it's an obsessive *fear* of having those thoughts or being that thing.  Likewise HOCD does not mean you have homosexual thoughts or anything against homosexuality, it's just a fear of being something you're not - an identity crisis, more than anything.

# Posting Guidelines

* As a rule of thumb, when you give advice, always be mindful of how you give it. You may not know the person, and as such you may not know how they will take the advice (in a good or a bad way).

* Don't be sorry your words bothered/offended somebody. Take responsibility and apologise for *your* actions.

* We recognise that PTSD is an equal opportunity condition. Everyone impacted by PTSD is welcome to seek support here. 

* r/ptsd is a support subreddit first and foremost. Derailing is not acceptable and may result in a ban, comment removal or both. The mod team will evaluate each situation on a case by case basis. 

* Cursing is fine, but hostility towards other posters is not tolerated. No trolling. No racist comments. Be respectful. 

* Victim blaming results in instant ban. 

* No graphic self-harm posts.  Suicidal posts/letters will be removed.  Encouraging suicide will result in a permanent ban. 

* Please do not give or seek medical advice. 

* No spamming or proselytising 'the solution that every one needs to know'. When in doubt - speak from the 'I'. 

* No self-fundraising type posts. 

* Please keep post titles as trigger free as much as humanely possible. Mark potentially triggering content as NSFW. Triggers can be added using flairs--the TW flair is editable!

* Use the post flairs!

* No personal contact information. Save that for PMs.

* Surveys and studies must be posted in sticky thread.

* Don't feed the trolls. Sadly, there are folks who enjoy trolling on support subreddits. Hit the report button - you're helping us keep r/ptsd a safe place.

* If you are using a new reddit account with no karma, your posts may be hidden by automod automatically. Just send us a  [modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/ptsd)and we can approve your post. 

# Suicide and graphic self-harm policy 

We recognize Reddit’s Suicide Policy and posts or comments advocating it will be removed as well we be suicide letters. If you are seeking help you will be directed to r/suicidewatch and hotlines. Suggesting others commit suicide will result in an immediate ban.

# Surveys and Research

*Surveys, research studies*, and the like must be posted in the sticky thread.  The current survey thread can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/pso7ox/survey_thread/). Mod approval is not required, and mod requests for survey posting approval will not be answered.

If you're new here and want to help, please read these two posts before diving in.   

If you've **lost someone** to suicide, /r/SuicideBereavement is there for you, or you can check out **[our shared list of bereavement resources](http://redd.it/i25yy)**.

#Guidelines#

1.  **This is a place of support.**  All the following ways of responding to at-risk OPs are strictly forbidden. If you see anything like this in a post or comment, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch).      
     * **Abuse or ""tough love""** ***including any guilt-tripping like ""suicide is selfish"" or ""think of your loved ones""***.      
     * **Pro-Suicide Posts or Comments,** ***or any explicit discussion of suicide methods***       
     * **Religious proselytizing**  
     * **Trolling or incitement to suicide or any type of self-harm or violence**    
     * **Anything that's not a direct, personal, supportive response to the OP.**

1.  **Please note that we are NOT a hotline!** We do NOT have the ability to trace the source of any posts, and we can't guarantee immediate responses. 

1.  **We offer non-judgemental peer support ONLY.**  The only requirement to respond here is genuine concern, so please don't take anything you read here as professional advice. It's fine to share what worked for you, but **DO NOT advocate for or against any specific type of therapy, self-help strategy, or medication, especially street drugs or alcohol, and DO NOT diagnose people** 

1.  **If you're here to help please respond** ***publicly*** **to our OPs in need.**  Sort by ""new"" and check for posts with few or no good responses.  The rules below link to posts with details.     
     * [Posts shouldn't include or request contact information.](http://redd.it/dmu24)  
     * [Don't ""advertise"" yourself as a helper, authority, or role model.  This includes inviting private contact as a first resort.](http://redd.it/xgrba)
     * [Do NOT post general ""uplifting"" or anti-suicide messages. Encouragement should never be offered until you've demonstrated understanding of the OP's emotions and experience, to ***their*** satisfaction, not yours! This also means no fundraising or activism, please.](http://redd.it/1cep2h) 
     * [Please, **never make promises to our vulnerable OPs that you personally can't keep**.  This means ***not*** saying ""it gets better"" or guaranteeing any outcomes!  It also means not to make any ""supportive"" but unverifiable assertions about the OP, i.e. telling them they're a good/strong/etc. person.](http://redd.it/25igd7)

1.  **We err on the side of safety**. If we need to remove a post or comment from someone who's reached out for help, we'll let them know why we removed it and how they can change it.  If this happens to you, please know that we **do** want to talk to you.  

1.  **If you need help but don't feel comfortable making a post** for any reason, please [**message the moderators**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch).  We will be glad to talk with you privately, or help in any other way that we can.

1.  Surveys and research participation requests ***must*** be pre-approved by the mod team. Posts we have okayed will be flaired.

1. Anything that's primarily of philosophical or scientific interest does not belong here."
50,uniqueminds,"The Alliance of Unique Minds is a subreddit dedicated to the appreciation of ""different kinds of minds"", with a focus on the reduction of stigma and injustice toward those with mental conditions, access to supportive and effective treatment to relieve suffering, and a recognition of the value of [neurodiversity](http://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/) for society. This is a place that takes seriously the idea that suffering is the problem, not the sufferers themselves.

Individuals with relevant diagnoses (e.g., PTSD, bipolar, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, schizophrenia, panic, agoraphobia, personality disorders, learning and cognitive disabilities, and those who fit lots of boxes or none of the boxes) are especially welcome, but family, friends, the undiagnosed, and all supportive allies are also encouraged to participate.

This is a place for discussion, sharing of ideas, and support. Please feel encouraged to contribute!

##About Us  
This subreddit was created for people that are unhappy or discontent to express themselves in a positive, supportive environment. You can share your experiences in an environment where people are encouraged to offer advice, support, empathy, understanding, and let you know that you're not going through this thing alone. We're here to accept you with nothing but kindness, and support. Let's talk.
  
Percent of posts responded to: **100%**
##Rules

1. **Be courteous to others.** One must remember that certain problems of others may not sound like a big deal to *you*, but if they're posting here, then they have a genuine reason for doing so. This is (and will always be) the #1 rule for this subreddit.  

2. Posts on this subreddit should **never be downvoted**. There's a reason there is no downvote arrow on this subreddit's page. If a submitted post appears to break a rule, then simply report it. But if it does not, then respect it as you would any other post. This subreddit is founded on the basis of respect, trust and understanding. Let's keep it that way. 

3. If someone has a problem that you're not sure how to respond to, then simply upvote them. Someone else out there will know what to say; if their post gets buried with no responses, then we haven't done our job.

3. Flagrant trolling, demoralizing or berating of any kind will not be tolerated and **will** get you banned **the first time.** Anyone who feels that they've been trolled or insulted on this subreddit should immediately report the post or comment using the ""report"" button.

4. If you have a question, comment or concern, feel free to message the mods and we'll get right back to you.  
  
##Reminders  

3. Give yourself a ""PM me!"" flair if you're okay with users messaging you privately about their problems.  
  
1. If your post falls off the front page and nobody catches it we strongly encourage you to REPOST IT. Once you've reposted it, please delete the original and assign it the ""Repost"" flair. Also, feel free to PM any user you see with the **""PM me!""** flair.  

2. If you must use a throwaway account, **PLEASE** remember to check it for replies. Lots of people go to lots of effort to help out around here and we don't like to see it go to waste.

#Need help with your relationship? 

######Whether it's romance, friendship, family, co-workers, or basic human interaction: we're here to help! 

1. **Posts must contain a title, description, a TLDR, and basic information such as ages, genders, length of relationship etc.**

2. **All submissions must request advice on a specific situation between two or more people**. No submissions *giving advice*, no links, no youtube videos, hypotheticals, general discussion/DAE/polls, adverts, or spam. 

3. **No moral judgment requests.** Moral judgement requests are asking people to evaluate actions taken or actions you want to take, in the context of right, wrong, selfish, or not selfish etc. For what a moral judgement question would be [please see this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/r6w9uh/meta_am_i_overreacting_am_i_the_asshole_is_this/)

4. **Things this sub can't give advice on**: Rants, unsolicited advice, letters to an ex, ""body counts"" or number of sexual partners, mental health issues, medical health issues, legal problems, financial problems, any situations involving minors (under 18 regardless of local laws), and any situations involving abuse (violence, sexual, emotional etc). All of these will be removed and locked. 

5. **You can submit an update post exactly once at any time after 48 hours has past from the original post.**

6. **Surveys, information requests, journalistic and academic research questions must be sent to modmail here and approved prior to posting.** If you're doing educational work, [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice) with your IRB number, a point of contact for us to verify your pending research, and the details of your research for consideration. Press Requests must be routed through u/eganist (via modmail. [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/relationship_advice)) before communicating with users directly.


##Comments

1. **All comments must be on topic and focus on the OP, in good faith.** Give good, ethical advice. Derailing arguments, jokes, fights, and moral whataboutism is not allowed. Remember, the goal is to help your fellow human.

2. **Keep it civil**. No name calling, insults, or insensitive language ([details](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/wiki/insults)). Insulting anyone (be it OP, the subject of the post, someone you know/used to know, users, etc) will result in post/comment removal, and the user being banned. This includes, but is not limited to: Whore, ho, hoe, slut, bitch, idiot, moron, slut shaming (including ""I can't get over their past""), slurs against someone's racial, ethnic, religious, gender or sexual identity. ***Please note that this is not an all-inclusive list.***. You will be banned. All bans in this sub are permanent. You don't get a free pass. We do not care who started it, or how deserving you think the subject of your ire.

3. **No referencing hateful or abusive subs/individuals and content**. No espousing rhetoric/linking to subs or content that is conspiratorial in nature, transphobic, anti-women/men, anti-LBGT+, that promote anti-vaxx or anti-science content, or contains harmful rhetoric against groups of people. You will be banned. All bans in this sub are permanent. You don't get a free pass. [More information can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/wiki/index)

##### Rules 


1. Posts should generally fit the ""self improvement"" mindset. You should be discussing or asking about something you'd like to personally improve, or offering tips and advice on how others can improve their lives. It helps to add your age, gender, and pertinent info in order to get more replies and assistance. 

2.  No photos, links or videos allowed in posts or comments. 

3.  No self-promotion or advertising. You may not invite others to join a company, group, channel, site, etc. you've created (free or not). Do not ask people to PM you. If you are not sure:  Ask before posting. (We are very strict about this.)

4. Please do not ask for, or give away any personal information regarding yourself, or another user.

5. Be sure to be civil. We're all here to discuss our own personal self improvements, not to bash each other. Do not encourage violence or criminal behavior, even as a joke. It's an instant ban. Also against reddit rules.

6. Abuse, bigotry, misogyny, misandry, racism, homophobia, gendered slurs, agendas and encouraging violence are not tolerated in our community and will result in a ban.

7. A ""thank you"" is always appreciated when others take time to help you. 

Posts may be removed and bans (temporary or permanent) may be issued without warning for violation of these rules.

56,confidence,"Confidence is the key to many things in life. Relationships, professional careers, school work, and success.  

Feel free to post questions, tips, advice, and stories related to confidence.  If you're feeling down, share why, and see if others can lift you back up.  If you're feeling awesome, share why, and see if you can inspire others.  

This sub should encourage conversation. If you'd like to post something encouraging, it should be a video or longer post (that is not your own blogspam and posts that link to paid ""improvement"" services will be removed). Motivation images should be posted to /r/GetMotivated or /r/Quotes. 

As Vince Lombardi famously said, 
""Confidence is contagious. So is lack of confidence.""



#**NOTE:**

Please tag the beginning of your post [Q] if you are asking for help/advice/tips. This will help people distinguish between helpful links, or questions that they can help out with.

If you don't have a question, but have some advice, please tag your post with [ADVICE]. (Make sure there are spaces before and after it, as there will be a discussion on using tags for color coded titles) Thanks!

#Rules:

###**Rule 1: No discrimination, sexism or racism**
* Pretty self explanatory this one, no discriminating based on a person's circumstances, this is a tolerant community and anyone found breaking these rules will be dealt with.

###**Rule 2: Please be kind**
* This isn't so much as a rule, but just worth remembering. Most of us here are quite vulnerable, so please just if you can, spare a kind word, and if not, at the very least don't try and make someone feel worse. 

###**Rule 3: No suicide encouragement, glorification, or notes**
* Also goes without saying, don't tell people to kill themselves, don't glorify suicide/death, and, unfortunately, we will have to remove any suicide notes from here, as whilst we want to help everyone, we do not want more people getting that idea.

###**Rule 4: Don't post personal information outside of PM's**
* For your own safety, do not post or comment your phone number, social media usernames etc. outside of private messages.

###**Rule 5: No NSFW or posts looking for a relationship**
* r/r4r might be more suited for that.. If someone ends up PM'ing you only for the purpose of getting nudes, etc. Instead of making a post ""exposing"" them, Send a message to the moderators so we can take action.

###**Rule 6: Don't spam, advertise or push your religion upon others**
* Your post/comment will be removed, and action might be taken.

###**Rule 7: Trigger warnings**

* Please apply proper trigger warning post flairs on posts talking about suicide, abuse or drugs."

[](#icon-cross)No pot-stirring or discussion of other subreddits.  
[](#icon-cross)No agenda questions. This is not your personal soapbox.

>[](#icon-check) Please be inclusive with question phrasing. Questions specifying majority demographics are not permitted.    
[](#icon-cross)  Downvote only to indicate that either a comment or post does not add to discussion; not to indicate disagreement. AskWomen benefits from honest answers with a variety of perspectives. On that note, saying, ""Be honest,"" is rude and unnecessary.

[](#icon-check)  Add flair!  We have flair for men, women, trans folks, and gender neutral people.     
[](#icon-check)  Be specific: ask a general question, get a general answer.   
[](#icon-check)  This is not a debate sub. Attempts to invalidate or argue someone else's response are not permitted.   
[](#icon-check)   Common topics are determined by how often the topics come up, how likely the answers are to change, and whether it is already a FAQ topic. The timeframe for considering something common or recently asked takes all of that into account.


[](#icon-exclamation)**Moderator Discretion:** While the rules of this sub are listed above, no set of rules can cover all of the content that people may post. Unfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover. In those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we find insidious, inflammatory, or that does not fit within the spirit of the community even if the stated rules do not specifically disallow that content.  In short, don't be an asshole

> ###Post Guidelines:

> * [](#icon-information) **The title of your post must contain an actual question.**  Keep your question concise.

> * [](#icon-cross) **Do not make posts asking about someone's/some group's actions, behavior, or thinking.** We're not fucking psychic. Go fucking ask them yourself.

> * [](#icon-cross) **Do not post pictures or ask questions looking for affirmation of your appearance or body features.** That includes boobs, butts, and your weird eyebrows. Seriously, we're gonna remove this shit.

> * [](#icon-cross) **Do not ask yes/no or one word answer questions.** This is not a fucking optional rule. If you are wondering if it applies to you, it does.

> * **No clickbait** (i.e. ""What do you think of this?"").

> * [](#icon-cross) **Do not post negative/forever alone rants or whiny posts.**  Visit /r/ForeverAlone or /r/rant if you want to complain.

> * [](#icon-cross) **Do not ask for gift ideas; visit /r/gifts.** You can't think of a gift idea? Neither can we lol

> * [](#icon-cross) **Do not complain about other subs here,** we're not your 1-800 hotline for issues with them.

> * [](#icon-cross) **Do not post just to push an agenda.** If you repeatedly ignore this, we will ban you.

> * [](#icon-cross) **Do not directly link to comments in other subs.**

> * [](#icon-cross) **Medical advice is not allowed here.**  We recommend talking to a medical professional instead of the Internet.

> * [](#icon-cross) **Overly political questions will be removed.**  There are subs like /r/politics and /r/PoliticalDiscussion if you want to debate political ideas or candidates.

> * [](#icon-information) **Frequently asked questions will be removed at our discretion.** Search the subreddit. Do not storm into the modmail with a bad attitude if this is the removal reason.

> * Sometimes automod fucks up - if you think it did, you can message us, but if you roll up to the modmail with a fucking attitude, we're not going to indulge you."
